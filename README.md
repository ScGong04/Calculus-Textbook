# Introduction to Calculus

## Preface

My name is 龚书诚(Shucheng Gong), and I am writing this calculus book to provide a clear and concise introduction to calculus for students from a college student’s perspective. As an engineering science student, I have found calculus to be an essential tool for understanding many of the concepts and principles that I encounter in my coursework. However, I know that many students struggle with calculus and find it intimidating. My hope is that this book will make calculus more approachable and accessible to a wider range of students.

The styling of the book is not going to be as rigorous (you will have rigorous calculus textbooks once you get into college), the point is to help everyone to understand calculus, and most importantly “ACE” the assessments.

### Advice from Author

You might have notice that math is subject that requires a lot practice. If there are some international students in your class who come from China, you might have noticed that they are generally good at math. You might think that they are all smart at math, but the fact is NOT necessarily. They are good at math purely because they have learnt a lot of materials beforehand and done an INSANE amount of practice. They spend more than one hour daily on their math homework. Don’t be surprised! So, be confident with yourselves! If you have done the same amount of practice, you will be as good!
